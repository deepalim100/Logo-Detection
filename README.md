# Logo-Detection
It's one of the part of object classification/Detection.I have tried to make it upto 90% but I have only reached at 76.19% accuracy.
In future I would try to make accuracy upto 90% and above.I have done this logo detection through CNN model. I have done the detection of 5 brands.
1)Audi
2)BMW
3)Chevrolet
4)Citroen
5)Volvo

when I have used large dataset ,I have been able to reach 90% but with the small dataset my accuracy decreases.
